# Personal Coach App

This project was my final **AP Computer Science Principles Performance Task**.  
It is an **interactive JavaScript application** that builds a personalized training plan based on the user's profile and preferences.

## Features

- **Validates** user input for name, age, weight, height, sport, training focus, and gym access
- Prompts the user to select training days
- Detects injury status and auto-adjusts training plan to **Recovery**
- Generates a personalized workout plan based on:
  - Chosen sport and focus (e.g., strength, speed)
  - Gym or home availability
  - Selected training days
- Delivers **motivational messages** by day
- Output includes all profile details and a **unique workout set** for each day

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript
- Regular Expressions
- Input validation
- Arrays, Objects, Functions
- Conditional logic and loops

## Purpose

This capstone project reflects everything I’ve learned in AP CSP — from validation logic and nested conditionals to user-focused interaction and function abstraction.  
It was designed and built entirely by me to show real-world application of computer science principles.
